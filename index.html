        <p>A bone is a rigid organ[1] that constitutes part of the skeleton in most vertebrate animals. Bones protect
             the various other organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body,
              and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and 
            have complex internal and external structures.[2] They are lightweight yet strong and hard and serve multiple functions.</p>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Bone is not uniformly solid, but consists of a flexible matrix (about 30%) and bound minerals
             (about 70%) which are intricately woven and endlessly remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells.
             Their unique composition and design allows bones to be relatively hard and strong, while remaining lightweight.</p>

    <h2>Cortex</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>The hard outer layer of bones is composed of cortical bone, which is also
         called compact bone as it is much denser than cancellous bone. It forms the hard exterior (cortex) of bones. 
         The cortical bone gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an
          adult human skeleton.[10] It facilitates bone's main functions—to support the whole body, to protect organs, to provide levers
           for movement, and to store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. It consists of multiple microscopic columns, each called an osteon
            or Haversian system. Each column is multiple layers of osteoblasts and osteocytes around a central canal called the haversian canal.
             Volkmann's canals at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a periosteum on its outer surface, and an endosteum on its inner surface. The endosteum is the boundary between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone.[11] The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical bone is the osteon</p>

    <h2>Trabeculae</h2>
 </div>   
 <div>
    <p><i>Further information: Trabecula § Bone trabecula</i></p>
 </div>
 <div>
     <p>Cancellous bone, or spongy bone,[12][11] also known as trabecular bone, is the internal tissue of the skeletal
         bone and is an open cell porous network that follows the material properties of biofoams.[13] Cancellous bone has a higher 
         surface-area-to-volume ratio than cortical bone and it is less dense. This makes it weaker and more flexible. The greater 
         surface area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. Cancellous bone is typically
          found at the ends of long bones, near joints, and in the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly vascular and often contains 
          red bone marrow where hematopoiesis, the production of blood cells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone 
          is the trabecula. The trabeculae are aligned towards the mechanical load distribution that a bone experiences within long bones such 
          as the femur. As far as short bones are concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the vertebral pedicle.[14] Thin formations 
          of osteoblasts covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces,[15] known as trabeculae. Within these spaces are bone marrow and
           hematopoietic stem cells that give rise to platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells.[15] Trabecular marrow is composed of a network
            of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ lighter and allow room for blood vessels and marrow. Trabecular bone accounts for 
            the remaining 20% of total bone mass but has nearly ten times the surface area of compact bone.[16]

        The words cancellous and trabecular refer to the tiny lattice-shaped units (trabeculae) that form the tissue. It was first illustrated accurately in the engravings of Crisóstomo Martinez.[17]</p>

    <h2>Marrow</h2>
 </div>
 <div>
    <p>Bone marrow, also known as myeloid tissue in red bone marrow, can be found in almost any bone that holds cancellous tissue. In newborns, all such bones are filled exclusively with red marrow or hematopoietic marrow, but as the child ages the hematopoietic fraction decreases in quantity and the fatty/ yellow fraction called marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increases in quantity. In adults, red marrow is mostly found in the bone marrow of the femur, the ribs, the vertebrae and pelvic bones.[18]</p>
 </div>
 <div>
    <h2>Vascular supply</h2>
    <p>Bone receives about 10% of cardiac output.[19] Blood enters the endosteum, flows through the marrow, and exits through small vessels in the cortex.[19] In humans, blood oxygen tension in bone marrow is about 6.6%, compared to about 12% in arterial blood, and 5% in venous and capillary blood.[1</p>
 </div>
 <div>
    <h2>Cells</h2>
 </div>
 <div>
    <p>Bone is metabolically active tissue composed of several types of cells. These cells include
         osteoblasts, which are involved in the creation and mineralization of bone tissue, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, which 
         are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are derived from osteoprogenitor cells, but osteoclasts are
          derived from the same cells that differentiate to form macrophages and monocytes.[20] Within the marrow of the bone there 
        are also hematopoietic stem cells. These cells give rise to other cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.[21]</p>

<div>
    <h2>Osteocyte</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Osteocytes are cells of mesenchymal origin and originate from osteoblasts that have migrated into and become
         trapped and surrounded by a bone matrix that they themselves produced.[11] The spaces the cell body of osteocytes occupy 
         within the mineralized collagen type I matrix are known as lacunae, while the osteocyte cell processes occupy channels called canaliculi. 
         The many processes of osteocytes reach out to meet osteoblasts, osteoclasts, bone lining cells, and other osteocytes probably for the purposes 
         of communication.[24] Osteocytes remain in 
        contact with other osteocytes in the bone through gap junctions—coupled cell processes which pass through the canalicular channels.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Osteoblast</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Osteoblasts are mononucleate bone-forming cells. They are located on the surface of osteon seams and make a protein mixture
         known as osteoid, which mineralizes to become bone.[22] The osteoid seam is a narrow region of a newly formed organic matrix, not yet mineralized, located on the surface of a bone. Osteoid is primarily composed of Type I collagen. Osteoblasts also manufacture hormones, such as prostaglandins, to act on the bone itself. The osteoblast creates and repairs new bone by actually building around itself. First, the osteoblast puts up collagen fibers. These collagen fibers are used as a framework for the osteoblasts' work. The osteoblast then deposits calcium phosphate which is hardened by hydroxide and bicarbonate ions. The brand-new bone created by the osteoblast is called osteoid.[23] Once the osteoblast is finished working it is actually trapped inside the bone once it hardens. When the osteoblast becomes trapped, it becomes known as an osteocyte. Other
         osteoblasts remain on the top of the new bone and are used to protect the underlying bone, these become known as lining cells.</p>

    <h2>Osteoclast</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Osteoclasts are very large multinucleate cells that are responsible for the breakdown of bones by the process of bone resorption.
         New bone is then formed by the osteoblasts. Bone is constantly remodeled by the resorption of osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts.[20]
          Osteoclasts are large cells with multiple nuclei located on bone surfaces in what are called Howship's lacunae (or resorption pits). 
          These lacunae are the result of surrounding bone tissue that has been reabsorbed.[25] Because the osteoclasts are derived from a monocyte 
          stem-cell lineage, they are equipped with phagocytic-like mechanisms similar to circulating macrophages.[20] Osteoclasts mature and/or 
          migrate to discrete bone surfaces. Upon arrival, active enzymes, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, are secreted against 
        the mineral substrate.[citation needed] The reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts also plays a role in calcium homeostasis.[25]</p>

    Skeletal System of Human Body
    Long bones are characterized by a shaft, the diaphysis, that is much longer than its width;
     and by an epiphysis, a rounded head at each end of the shaft. They are made up mostly of compact bone, with lesser amounts of marrow, located within the medullary cavity, and areas of spongy, cancellous bone at the ends of the bones.[34] Most bones of the limbs, including those of the fingers and toes, are long bones. The exceptions are the eight carpal bones of the wrist, the seven articulating tarsal bones of the ankle and the sesamoid bone of the 
    kneecap. Long bones such as the clavicle, that have a differently shaped shaft or ends are also called modified long bones.

        Flat bones are thin and generally curved, with two parallel
         layers of compact bone sandwiching a layer of spongy bone. Most of the bones of the skull are flat bones, as is the sternum.[36]
    </li>
    <li>
        Sesamoid bones are bones embedded in tendons. Since they act to hold the tendon further away from the joint, the angle 
        of the tendon is increased and thus the leverage of the muscle is increased. Examples of sesamoid bones are the patella and the pisiform.[37]
    </li>
    <li>
        Irregular bones do not fit into the above categories. They consist of thin layers of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior. As implied by the name, their shapes are irregular and complicated. Often this irregular shape is due to their many centers of ossification or because they contain bony sinuses.
         The bones of the spine, pelvis, and some bones of the skull are irregular bones. Examples include the ethmoid and sphenoid bones.[38]

<p><i>Main article: Anatomical terms of bone</i></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In the study of anatomy, anatomists use a number of anatomical terms to describe the appearance, shape and function of bones. Other anatomical terms are also used to describe the location of bones. Like other anatomical terms, many of these derive from Latin and Greek. Some anatomists still use Latin to refer to bones. The term "osseous", and the prefix "osteo-", referring to things related to bone, are still used commonly today.

            Some examples of terms used to describe bones include the term "foramen" to describe a hole through which something passes, and a "canal" or "meatus" to describe a tunnel-like structure. A protrusion from a bone can be called a number of terms, including a "condyle", "crest", "spine", "eminence", "tubercle" or "tuberosity", depending on the protrusion's shape and location. In general, long bones are said to have a "head", "neck", and "body".
            
            When two bones join, they are said to "articulate". If the two bones have a fibrous connection and are relatively immobile, then the joint is called a "suture".</p>

    <p><i>Endochondral ossification</i></p>
<del>
    <p>The formation of bone is called ossification. During the fetal stage of development this occurs by two processes: intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification.[39] Intramembranous ossification involves the formation of bone from connective tissue whereas endochondral ossification involves the formation of bone from cartilage.

        Intramembranous ossification mainly occurs during formation of the flat bones of the skull but also the mandible, maxilla, and clavicles; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as mesenchyme tissue rather than from cartilage. The process includes: the development of the ossification center, calcification, trabeculae formation and the development of the periosteum.[40]</p>
